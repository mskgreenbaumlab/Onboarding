Login using MSK ID and password.
Under the "Quick Badge" tab, you can clock in or clock out for the day.
When clocking in for the day, answer NO to the question "Are you badging out for this shift?" and Save.
When clocking out for the day, answer YES to the same question and answer YES to the follow-up question "Did you take your full or part-time meal?"; make sure to Save.
If you forgot to check in or out and need to add a time record, then go to the "Employee" tab and select "Add Clocking" (lower left corner). Input the time (military time) and date. The "User Shift Answer" asks the same question as "Are you badging out for this shift?", so answer accordingly depending on clock-in or clock-out. 


## Communication
### Slack (primary method of communication)
Fill out this form requesting access for Slack, Box, and GSuite - https://thespot.mskcc.org/esc?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=6613a2cadbdf5c10636a0e85ca9619d8
Reach out to Tiffany Cordero (corderot@mskcc.org) regarding a Slack request. Once she invites you, you can use your MSK email to join the Slack.
Workspace name: greenbaumlab.slack.com
Teams
Some labs use Teams for instant message or file sharing. Some people prefer it because it's integrated with other Microsoft products (eg. file sharing, calendar).

https://teams.microsoft.com/

### Outlook (main method of emailing)
Web version: https://outlook.office.com/mail/

Desktop app: https://slack.com/downloads



## VPN Access
Contact MSK SPOT 646.227.3337 or techspot@mskcc.org to apply for VPN access. <br>
If you already have VPN access and need to request VPN access for someone else. use this link to request for VPN Access - https://thespot.mskcc.org/esc?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=6db5368fdb21d0508b78a2ad13961958 <br>
Depending on an Employee or Non-Employee Request, fill out the fields with the proper information (questions that ask "describe your request", "summary", "special instructions", etc. can be filled out with a generic overview of the request).<br>
After submitting your ticket, Dr. Greenbaum will have to approve the request before moving forward.<br>
Then, follow the instructions on Global Protect: https://mskcc.ent.box.com/v/gp-install-instructions


## Virtual Computer Desktop (VCD)
The VPN Access request could take some time to process so the VCD is an alternative method of accessing MSK resources from home.
First, download the Citrix Workspace at: https://citrix.com/receiver
Then, go to http://start.mskcc.org/ and log in with you MSK account.
Once you've signed in, click on the "Virtual Computer Desktop" option and open with Citrix.
You should see a new window open up which should give you access to the MSK network.
You'll be able to sign in and sign out through the VCD.

For HPC cluster, Dr. Greenbaum's lab uses Juno.
Fill out the PI and admin fields with Dr. Greenbaum's information.
The Cost Center number is on your ID Badge.

Fund Number: reach out to Cristina Radu (raduc@mskcc.org) or Aimee for fund number
Cost Number: 17553 (please confirm with Cynthia berryc@mskcc.org or Cristina raduc@mskcc.org )

(the cost center contains all the funds of the lab.the cc of the Greenbaum Lab is 50515, but it has over 6 funds.)

## HPC Configuration

### Environment Module
To use lab's shared environment modules on juno/lilac, create following file `~/.modulerc`. then paste following lines in it.
```
#%Module
prepend-path MODULEPATH /juno/work/greenbaum/modulefiles
```

### Conda Environment
to use lab's conda environment on Juno

add following lines to `~/.bashrc` to initialize lab's conda 

```
# >>> conda initialize >>>
# !! Contents within this block are managed by 'conda init' !!
__conda_setup="$('/work/greenbaum/software/Miniconda3/bin/conda' 'shell.bash' 'hook' 2> /dev/null)"
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
    eval "$__conda_setup"
else
    if [ -f "/work/greenbaum/software/Miniconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh" ]; then
        . "/work/greenbaum/software/Miniconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh"
    else
        export PATH="/work/greenbaum/software/Miniconda3/bin:$PATH"
    fi
fi
unset __conda_setup
# <<< conda initialize <<<
```

then `source ~/.bashrc`  to initialize lab's conda in current session. no need for future ssh session.


### LD_LIBRARY_PATH
The lab has a shared library for shared applications. You can add this environment variable into `~/.bashrc` file so dynamic link loader can find it for your application.

```
# shared library for the lab
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/work/greenbaum/software/lib/
```
